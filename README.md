- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @Sungj1nn, a beginner in reverse engineering. 
- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in learning more about how software works at a deep level, and I'm excited to start my journey into this field.
- ðŸŒ± Here are some of the things I'm currently learning: x86 assembly, WebAssembly, Computer architecture, Windows internals, Polyglote files, Regular expressions
  
- I'm also interested in learning about:
      Malware analysis,
      Software security,
      Reverse engineering tools
  
I'm always looking for new challenges, so if you have any ideas for projects or collaboration, please let me know.

Thanks for reading!
